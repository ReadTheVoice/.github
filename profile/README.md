# ReadTheVoice

## About the organization

In the "Projet thématique" module of the final year of the "Cloud Computing and Mobility" Master's program at INSSET (Institut Supérieur des Sciences Et Techniques, located in Saint-Quentin, France), we have to carry out a project combining the different worlds we have studied over our two years (cloud, mobile, web, infra, etc.).
Our group of three students has chosen to work on the theme of accessibility, and more specifically on the accessibility of conferences for people with hearing impairments.
This README.md file will be used to present our project, our team, and our concept.

## Concept

### What is ReadTheVoice?

Introducing ReadTheVoice: real-time audio-to-text transcription for seamless integration into conferences, lectures, and beyond. Designed with inclusivity in mind, our application aims to enhance accessibility for individuals with hearing impairments and those situated at a distance from the speaker.

### How does it work? 

Speakers simply create an account on our user-friendly web application and log in. Upon creating a meeting, a unique link and QR code are generated. Attendees can effortlessly scan the QR code using their mobile devices. Notably, no account is required for the audience, streamlining the process.

### What makes ReadTheVoice unique?

Leveraging the power of Deepgram's API, our transcription system operates seamlessly in the background. 
For added convenience, a mobile application is provided, simplifying QR code scanning and ensuring a backup of the transcription is readily available. Speakers, utilizing a microphone connected to their browser (integrated or USB), can seamlessly use our platform. ReadTheVoice's APIs not only facilitate real-time transcription, but also manage the storage and distribution of transcriptions to the public.

### What are the benefits of ReadTheVoice?

The benefits of ReadTheVoice are numerous. For speakers, ReadTheVoice provides a simple, user-friendly interface for managing meeting transcriptions. For attendees, ReadTheVoice provides a convenient, accessible means of following along with the speaker and provides also a means of accessing transcriptions after the meeting has concluded.
